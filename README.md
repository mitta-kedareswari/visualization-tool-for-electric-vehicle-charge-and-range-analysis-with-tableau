⚡ Visualizing Electric Vehicle Market Trends
An Analysis of EV Performance, Pricing, and Market Dynamics Using Tableau

📌 Project Overview
Developed for LTVIP2025TMID50379, this project analyzes global and Indian electric vehicle (EV) market data to uncover insights on adoption drivers, pricing strategies, and performance metrics.

By exploring key parameters such as range, efficiency, charging capabilities, and pricing, the project supports strategic market planning and investment decisions.
Interactive dashboards created in Tableau allow stakeholders—including automotive analysts, market researchers, and executives—to interpret complex EV data effectively.
