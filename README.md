⚡ Visualizing Electric Vehicle Market Trends
An Analysis of EV Performance, Pricing, and Market Dynamics Using Tableau

📌 Project Overview
Developed for LTVIP2025TMID50379, this project analyzes global and Indian electric vehicle (EV) market data to uncover insights on EV adoption drivers, pricing strategies, and performance metrics. By exploring key parameters such as range, efficiency, charging capabilities, and pricing, the project supports strategic market planning and investment decisions.
Interactive dashboards built in Tableau empower stakeholders—including automotive analysts, market researchers, and executives—to interpret complex EV data with ease.

🎯 Objectives
Analyze how performance metrics (range, acceleration, efficiency) influence EV pricing
Examine EV distribution across segments, brands, and market regions
Compare global EV trends with Indian market preferences
Deliver actionable, data-driven insights to support strategic decision-making
Present EV trends through interactive, accessible visualizations
